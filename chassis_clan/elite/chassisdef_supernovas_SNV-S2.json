It mounts an Ultra AC/20 in each arm supported by a Large Pulse Laser in the right torso and an LRM-15 rack in the left. As it was built upon the frame of the standard Supernova, it retains the jump jets but mounts only seventeen double heat sinks. Like its progenitor, the Boiler lacks field endurance, carrying only two tons of Ultra Autocannon rounds and one ton of LRM reloads.<br><br>S-class mechs feature upgrades to their armour, thermal management and defensive systems that substantially improve their survivability on the 31st century battlefield.",
