    "Description" : "The Word of Blake is an extremist faction of ComStar that originated from a backlash against the removal of that organization's mystical and religious aspects. Initially persecuted by their secular foes, the Blakists took refuge in the Free Worlds League before seizing control of Terra and moving their operations there. The dissolution of the Second Star League saw the Word of Blake proclaim a <i>Jihad<\/>, or religious crusade seeking to reunify the Inner Sphere under their control.",
