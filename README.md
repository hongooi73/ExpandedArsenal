**Expanded Arsenal** adds 400+ new mech variants (266 Inner Sphere and 184 Clan), new weapons, vehicles and turrets ranging from the Star League to the Civil War era using the Community Asset Bundle (CAB). This mod is the spiritual successor to Vanilla Plus by Mattyxr, and includes 99% of the content from that mod. The aim is to vastly expand the selection of units that you can encounter on the battlefield, giving you new enemies to fight and new loot to collect.

Expanded Arsenal is unique among the major modpacks in not changing the core gameplay mechanics at all. If you know how vanilla HBS BattleTech works, you know how EA works. Of course, that doesn't mean everything plays exactly the same -- that would be boring. By providing new mechs and new gear, EA changes the tactics and strategies that you can employ, which keeps things fresh. In particular EA bundles a number of mods that are specifically intended to provide you with extra challenge, and extra rewards for meeting that challenge.

As a relatively lightweight mod, Expanded Arsenal can be used in either campaign or career mode. It can also be dropped into a game in progress; you don't have to start a new game to play it.


## Installation

The CAB is required and can be found here:
https://discourse.modsinexile.com/t/community-assests-bundle-cab/115

1. Install the CAB to your main battletech folder. This is usually "C:\Steam\Steamapps\common\BATTLETECH\Mods" for a Steam installation.
1. Extract the Expanded Arsenal folder to: "steamapps\common\BATTLETECH\Mods"
1. Run ModTekInjector.exe in the "BATTLETECH\Mods\modtek" folder

Note that if you have a previous Expanded Arsenal install, you should **delete** the ExpandedArsenal, EliteArsenal, EliteForces and MissionControl folders underneath your Mods folder before installing the latest version.

Expanded Arsenal can be installed as an upgrade from Vanilla Plus; after doing this, delete the VP mod folders to avoid any clashes. However, it isn't meant to be used with other large modpacks, and doing so will most likely break your game.

### Elite content

With the amount of new toys that EA provides, things can get a bit stale after a while. The following mods are intended to provide extra challenge -- and extra rewards to go with it.

**Elite Forces** adds over 80 new mech variants and vehicles, using ++ and +++ weaponry and upgrades from the vanilla game. Piloting them are 60-odd new NPC mechwarriors with higher skill levels than the default opfor pilots. The best elite pilots are aces, with unique abilities that make them tough opponents on the battlefield.

**Elite Arsenal** adds several features to build on the core Expanded Arsenal + Elite Forces gameplay:
- \+ and ++ variants of Expanded Arsenal weapons and gear. If you've outfitted all your mechs with heavy gauss rifles, ER lasers and Streak SRMs, this is the upgrade path you're looking for.
- 200 new variants of Expanded Arsenal mechs, which are deadlier and tougher than even those from Elite Forces.
- Elite versions of all the regular missions.
- Soft restrictions on drop tonnage in contracts: pay for the privilege of dropping 400 tons on a 1-skull mission.
- Tweaks to the AI that make it more aggressive and unpredictable, taken from the Better AI mod.

Elite Arsenal mechs come in two varieties, X- and S-tier. X-tier mechs have more effective builds, + weapons and extra toughness compared to regular EA and vanilla mechs. S-tier mechs have ++ weapons, even more toughness, and added heatsinking capacity; in addition, they are always piloted by ace mechwarriors from Elite Forces. It's entirely feasible for an S-tier mech to destroy an enemy mech of equivalent tonnage in a single alpha strike. On the flipside though, once you do kill one of these mechs, you get to loot all its goodies.

By default Elite Arsenal is disabled, so as not to overwhelm you at the start of a game. The recommended approach is to play with only Elite Forces enabled while you get your team established, then enable Elite Arsenal. Once you have veteran pilots, take elite contracts to get the hardest fights and the best loot.

### Quality of life

In addition, the following included mods are optional: you don't have to use them, but they make the game just a little more fun.

- Panic System
- Skip Intro
- Repair Bays
- Mech Affinity
- Pilot Fatigue
- LAMs (requires Elite Arsenal)
