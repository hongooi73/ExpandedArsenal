## v1.3.1

- Targeting Computer Mk I now ignores 2 evasion pips with ballistic and energy weapons, rather than giving +2 accuracy
  - Ignoring evasion should be much more powerful than accuracy, and appropriate for an item weighing 3 tons (more than a +++TTS)
- Targeting Computer Mk II renamed to Targeting Computer +, to match the vanilla convention of +/++/+++ variants representing upgrades; ignores 2 evasion pips; reduced to 2 tons
- IS Artemis IV ignores 2 evasion pips with missile weapons, rather than giving an accuracy bonus
- Clan Artemis IV ignores 2 evasion pips, and also grants +50% crit chance
- Fix heatsinks and jumpjets for Hauptmann
