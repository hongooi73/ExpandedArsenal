The Hellspawn is built on an Endo Steel chassis and a 270 XL engine that gives it a top speed of 97.2 km/h. For protection, the Hellspawn is equipped with a Guardian ECM Suite and has six and a half tons of armor that is barely adequate when compared to other medium 'Mechs. To enhance the 'Mech's mobility it has six jump jets. The 8E is a variant aimed at increasing the 'Mech's long range effectiveness. Two of the Medium Pulse Lasers have been traded for lighter ER Medium Lasers and an Artemis IV system has been added to the LRMs.<br><br>X-class mechs feature upgrades to their armour and defensive systems that improve their survivability on the 31st century battlefield.",
