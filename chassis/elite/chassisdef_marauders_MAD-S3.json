A direct upgrade of the 3D model, the 5D's engine was replaced with a General Motors 300 XL Engine, retaining the same speed profile at a much-reduced weight, to allow the entire weapons payload to be stripped out and upgraded. The 5D's primary weapons were two Defiance 1001 ER PPCs, carried in either arm, supported by a Sutel Precision Line Large Pulse Laser in place of the autocannon. The medium lasers were replaced with two Sutel Precision Line Medium Pulse Lasers, while a Federated SuperStreak Streak SRM-2 launcher was also added to the left torso.<br><br>S-class mechs feature upgrades to their armour, thermal management and defensive systems that substantially improve their survivability on the 31st century battlefield.",
