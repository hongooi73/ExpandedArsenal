This reliable workhorse of the SLDF, while not excelling in any one job, was capable of accomplishing just about any mission, whether it be close assault, anti-aircraft, counter-insurgency, or even reconnaissance. Its versatility and large number of manufactures ensured the Crusader its place as one of the most common heavy Mechs in the Inner Sphere.",
