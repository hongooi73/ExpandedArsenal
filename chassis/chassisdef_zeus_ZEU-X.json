The 'Mech was built using a Composite chassis which weighed half as much as a regular chassis, but was only half as strong as a normal internal structure. The 'Mech was also armored with both normal armor and Reactive Armor on its limbs. The 'Mech was armed with an LB-X Autocannon/20 as its primary weapon, backed up by an MRM 30 launcher. The ZEU-X carried three tons of ammunition for the LB-X AC/20 and two tons for the MRM 30, stored in the right torso and protected by CASE II. For close combat, the Zeus had two Medium X-Pulse Lasers. Finally, for added speed, the 'Mech was built using an XXL engine which weighed only seventeen and a half tons, giving the 'Mech a maximum speed of 86 kph, and carried a dozen Double Heat Sinks. The ZEU-X was the most heavily armored of the Zeus X variants to enter service prior to the Blackout, mounting a full fifteen and a half tons of armor.",
